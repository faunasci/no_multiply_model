# no_multiply_model
This project explores the implementation of **Shift-Add Neural Networks** as an alternative to standard multiplication-based neural networks. Inspired by the Ancient Egyptian multiplication method (multiplication by doubling and adding), this model replaces standard linear layers with a quantized version where weights are powers of two.
